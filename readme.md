# Zombie Squad
Charitable cause to rid the world of the living dead! 

## Getting Started
The Zombie Apocalypse is upon us! Pay attention as these instructions will help keep you and your squad alive! This online guide will teach you real skills and teamwork principles that can save your life in any zombie encounter. Our signature zombie website will turn any group of people into a survival zombie squad. Zombie Squad is here to empower you with real life-saving skills and turn you and your team into zompocalyptic badasses.

## Tools
Even though this zombie survival guide is thorough enough to help you survive an outbreak at any given time, we still suggest you equip yourself with the suggested tools below:

- Wooden bat covered in barbed wire
- A really big knife
- Holy water
- Wooden stake (best when aiming for the brain directly!)
- And a lot of Redbull!


## Field Preparation
This website focuses on the teamwork and communication aspects of survival. Perfect for both online and offline, we use group-based problem solving modules to help each team learn different leadership styles through different forms of communication (you can use more than your mouth to encourage people!).

## Zombie Breakdown: Survival Tests 
Zombie apocalypse just got real! Experience the ultimate outbreak adventure. Oh no!  Zombies!  Who could have foreseen?  Test your newly acquired skills to evade and destroy the undead.  

- Groups will be formed. 
- Missions will be accomplished.  
- Zombies will be dispatched.  
- Lunch will be eaten.  
- Then back to the zombies!  

Get ready for the most fun you'll ever have while running for your life.  And if you get caught, you still get to play (though you may develop a taste for brains).
